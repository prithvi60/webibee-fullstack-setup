                <Question title="How does the design process work at Design Management Hub?">
                    <p>
                        Our process begins with a consultation where we understand your vision, preferences, and budget. After that, we present design concepts, materials, and color schemes. Once the design is finalized, we manage the entire project from sourcing materials to overseeing installation, ensuring a seamless experience.

                <Question title="How long does a typical interior design project take?">
                    <p>
                        The timeline for a project varies depending on its size and complexity. For smaller projects, such as a single room, it may take 4-6 weeks. Larger projects like a full home or commercial space can take several months. We’ll provide a detailed project timeline after the initial consultation.

                <Question title="How do you determine the cost of a project?">
                    <p>
                        The cost of a project depends on various factors, including the scope of work, materials chosen, and the size of the space. After our initial consultation, we will provide a detailed estimate outlining the costs for design, materials, and labor.
